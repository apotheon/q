# Q
 
At the moment, this is a catch-all project for nascent infrastructure and
tooling development related to the Fossil Record ideal.  At this time, it is
(perhaps naively) assumed to be a strictly Ruby targeted project for the
foreseeable future.
 
## fossrec

The executable command line `fossrec` utility aims to be a wrapper for the
sometimes complex and user-hostile process of creating and synchronizing Fossil
repositories across domains, particularly as regards "local" repositories and
repositories hosted by FossRec itself.
 
## FossRec

The FossRec library aims to implement a Ruby API for Fossil SCM and canonical
FossRec (service, toolset, and web presence) itself.
